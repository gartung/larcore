///  knowledge that is required by the Geometry service. Experiments implement the
///  private virtual functions within a concrete service provider class to perform
///  the specified actions as appropriate for the particular experiment. It is
///  expected that such requests will occur infrequently within a job. Calculations
///  that occur frequently should be handled via interfaces that are passed

///
///  Note that the public interface for this service cannot be overriden. The
///  experiment-specific sub-classes should implement only the private methods
///  without promoting their visibility.
